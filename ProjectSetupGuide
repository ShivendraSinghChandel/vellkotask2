Frontend (React) Setup:
1. Prerequisites:

Install Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org.
npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, so once you install Node.js, you should also have npm.

2. Steps:


 i. Extract the Project Folder:

 Unzip the project folder you’ve sent and place it in a location of your choice on your machine.


 ii. Install Dependencies:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend folder (where your package.json is located). If you’ve extracted the project to my-app, run:

cd path/to/my-app


 iii. Install the Node.js dependencies:

Since the node_modules folder is not included in the zip file, you need to install the dependencies manually. Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

npm install


3. Start the Development Server:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server using:

npm start
This will run the React application on http://localhost:3000 by default, unless you configured a different port.



Backend Setup (PHP)

1. Prerequisites:

XAMPP installed on your machine. You can download it from XAMPP website.
MySQL service enabled via XAMPP for database management.

2. Steps:
 Set Up the Backend (PHP):

 i. Extract the backend folder (e.g., backend) inside your htdocs folder in the XAMPP directory (e.g.,   C:\xampp\htdocs). Your directory structure should look something like this:

 C:\xampp\htdocs\backend\

 ii. Create the Database in MySQL:

 Open phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.

 Create a new database called multistep_form (or any name you choose, but make sure it matches the PHP file).

 Create a table inside this database called form_data with columns for all the form fields:

 CREATE TABLE form_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    zip_code VARCHAR(5),
    service_type VARCHAR(255),
    roof_action VARCHAR(255),
    location_type VARCHAR(255),
    timing VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    street_address VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(255),
    state VARCHAR(255),
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(10)
);

iii. Edit PHP Files to Connect to Database:

 In the PHP file (submit-form.php), make sure to update the database credentials (username, password) as required by your MySQL setup. For example:

 $servername = "localhost";  
 $username = "root";         
 $password = "";  // Set your password here if it's not the default empty one
 $dbname = "multistep_form";


3. Start XAMPP Services:

Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. These will handle your PHP and MySQL requests.

4. Verify PHP Backend:

Once the services are running, you can access your PHP script by visiting:

http://localhost/backend/submit-form.php
